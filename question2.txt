In pre-processing, comments are removed and the files are expanded. A missing ehader file like #include could result in incorrect macro definitions when expanding. Next is compiling, which creates an output file with assembly level instructions. Using incorrect syntax, like missing semicolons or mispelled words can result in error. The next stage is assembly, which is when the output file is taken as input and turned into a .o file by the assembler. This file has machine level instructions. Errors are not common at this stage, since the code already compiled correctly. Next is linking, which is function calls are linked wth their definitions. Some extra code is also added to the program that is required when the program starts and ends. If the same function is dfined in multiple object files there could be an error. Finally, there is loading. Loading is when the OS takes the file and loads it into RAM. If the program needs more memory than is availiable there will be an error.
